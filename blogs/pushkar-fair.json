The Pushkar Cattle Fair, held annually in the small Rajasthani town of Pushkar, is one such place. Imagine a desert transformed into a carnival of colour, where camels are dressed in finery grander than a fashion runway, and holy chants create ripples on the waters of a sacred lake."

Competitions range from \"Best Decorated Camel\" to \"Longest Moustache,\" and while the latter is for the menfolk, it's the camels who inevitably steal the show."
